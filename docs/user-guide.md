### First Steps

1. Open any Quarto or Markdown file
2. Place cursor on any headline (line starting with `#`)
3. Press `Cmd+Shift+,` to cycle folding states
4. Open the tree viewer: `Cmd+Shift+T`

## Basic Operations

### Folding

**Cycle Folding** (`Cmd+Shift+,`)

The main operation for managing document visibility. Behavior depends on whether the headline has children:

**For headlines WITHOUT children:**
- Press once: Fold content
- Press again: Unfold content

**For headlines WITH children:**
- Press once: Fold everything (shows only headline)
- Press again: Show children (children are folded)
- Press third time: Expand all (everything visible)

**Example:**
```markdown
# Introduction              ‚Üê Press Cmd+Shift+, here

Text about the topic...

## Background              ‚Üê Child headline
More details...

## Methods                 ‚Üê Another child
Even more...
```

**Global Operations:**
- `Cmd+F1` - Fold all headlines
- `Cmd+F2` - Unfold all headlines

### Moving Headlines

**Move Up** (`Alt+Shift+‚Üë`)
Swaps current headline with previous sibling at same level.

**Move Down** (`Alt+Shift+‚Üì`)  
Swaps current headline with next sibling at same level.

**Important:** Only headlines at the same level swap. Children move with their parent.

**Example:**
```markdown
# Methods
## Data Collection      ‚Üê Move down
## Sample Size          ‚Üê Becomes: Sample Size above Data Collection
## Analysis
```

### Restructuring

**Promote** (`Cmd+Shift+‚Üê`)  
Decreases headline level (removes one `#`)

```markdown
## Sub-section    ‚Üí    # Sub-section
```

**Demote** (`Cmd+Shift+‚Üí`)  
Increases headline level (adds one `#`)

```markdown
# Main Section    ‚Üí    ## Main Section
```

### Content Operations

**Copy** (`Alt+Shift+C`)  
Copies headline and all its content/children to clipboard.

**Cut** (`Alt+Shift+X`)  
Cuts headline and all its content/children to clipboard.

**Delete** (`Alt+Shift+D`)  
Permanently deletes headline and all its content/children.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Delete is permanent. Use `Cmd+Z` to undo if needed.

## Tips & Tricks

### Efficient Navigation

**Use Folding Strategically:**
- Start editing session with `Cmd+F1` (fold all)
- Expand only what you're working on
- Reduces cognitive load and distraction

**Tree View as Map:**
- Keep tree view open while writing
- Provides document context
- Quick navigation between sections

**Keyboard-Driven Workflow:**
- Learn core shortcuts first (fold, move, promote/demote)
- Command palette for occasional operations
- Tree view for visual overview

### Structuring Documents

**Clear Hierarchy:**
- Use consistent heading levels
- Don't skip levels (# ‚Üí ### without ##)
- Tree view makes structure obvious

**Meaningful Headlines:**
- Descriptive titles aid navigation
- Show up in tree view
- Help with document overview

**Chunk Content:**
- Break long sections into subsections
- Easier to fold and navigate
- Better for collaborative editing

### YAML Frontmatter

All operations respect YAML frontmatter:
```markdown
---
title: "My Document"
format: html
---

# First Real Headline    ‚Üê Operations start here
```

The YAML block is never included in folding or editing operations.

### Performance

- Works instantly on documents up to 10,000 lines
- Tree view updates in real-time
- No performance impact on typing

For very large documents:
- Consider splitting into multiple files
- Use folding to work on sections
- Tree view helps manage complexity

### Backup & Undo

- All editing operations are undoable: `Cmd+Z`
- VSCode/Cursor auto-saves (configure in settings)
- Use version control (Git) for important documents

### Audio Dictation Best Practices

- Record in quiet environment
- Speak clearly and at normal pace
- Review audio before transcription (future feature)
- Audio files stored locally, not in cloud

## Troubleshooting

### Shortcuts Not Working

1. Check you're in `.qmd` or `.md` file
2. Check file type in status bar
3. Try reloading window: `Cmd+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Reload Window"

### Tree View Not Showing

1. Check sidebar is open
2. Look for "Quarto Outline" panel
3. Try closing and reopening: `Cmd+Shift+T`

### Folding Not Working

1. Ensure headline has content to fold
2. Check headline syntax (`#` followed by space)
3. Try global operations (`Cmd+F1`, `Cmd+F2`) to reset

### Audio Recording Issues

1. Check microphone permissions
2. Try different browser (if in web version)
3. Check console for error messages
